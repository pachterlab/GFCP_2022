# gg to do:

potentially better to have the naive linear regression for raw data (the quantile thing is a MESS for real data)

fix your simulations! having tens of thousands of transcripts looks absurd. In fact, it would be most useful to draw from a joint distribution that a priori reproduces the stats of a real dataset. See La Manno SN2 validation for details. (this isn't a topmost priority, because sims are modular).
